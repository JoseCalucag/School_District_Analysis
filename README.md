## Project Background
The school board recognized that there was evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically with the altering of reading and math grades of grade nine students at Thomas High School. While administrators do not know the full extent of the changes, they want to uphold their testing standards by keeping the unaltered grades while looking at methods to eliminate the altered grades with losing the data's overall integrity. Once finished my assessment, I am to report my results and describe if there were any changes to my overall analysis.

## Overview
After assessing the situation, I decided the best approach is to:
- Replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School with NaNs
- Keep all other data associated with the ninth-grade students and Thomas High School intact.


## Results
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type

## Summary
Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
