## Project Background
The school board recognized that there was evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically with the altering of reading and math grades of grade nine students at Thomas High School. While administrators do not know the full extent of the changes, they want to uphold their testing standards by keeping the unaltered grades while looking at methods to eliminate the altered grades with losing the data's overall integrity. Once finished my assessment, I am to report my results and describe if there were any changes to my overall analysis.

## Overview
After assessing the situation, I decided the best approach is to:
- Replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School with NaNs.
- Keep all other data outside of the ninth-grade Thomas High school students intact.
- Reassess the new data set and it's revised results

## Results
From my assessment, we can see that some of the percentages are different; albeit small, but based upon the scale, it's rather significant. Moreso, when we see the reading average percentage, we see that it actually goes up by about 4%.

## Summary
By isolating and declaring unwanted data (like possible altered and falsified data), we can eliminate them and still create an accurate data set without having to re-test or revalue our data standards.
